                is

                6,000
                different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate

                American

                Argues
                that
                genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
                Says
                that GM
                crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for
                a
                long
                time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
